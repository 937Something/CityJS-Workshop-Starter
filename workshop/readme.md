# CityJS Workshop

Hello, welcome! This is the "Build your own Serverless tic tac toe AI using Node.js and (a little bit of) TensorFlow.js" Workshop. I hope you are in the right place! 

First off let's introduce ourselves:

Hew - Javascript Pirate...

Thomas - Javascript Ninja...

Over the next 2.5 hours, we will help you learn about serverless functions, good use cases of them, and bad ones! We will also show you how easy it is to build, test, and deploy them.

## Prerequisites
If you need any help with the prerequisites send either of us a message and we will try help out.

  * 1 laptop
  * node.js and git installed.
  * 1 GitHub account
  * Some basic Javascript knowledge
  * Over 9000 patience for silliness

## Introduction

Our goal is to help you get a basic understanding of Serverless, otherwise known as Functions As A Service. We hope to do this by working through an examples together for use cases that don't really make sense but Hew it made work anyway (what a hero). 

The example will push serverless to its limits exposing some of the challenges, like cold starts.
